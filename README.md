# JavaScript Programs using Conditional Statements

This repository contains basic **JavaScript programs** that are created using only **conditional statements**.  
The focus is on learning how to use `if` and `if...else if` ladder statements to control the flow of a program.  
No loops, no switch, and no nested conditions are used â€” only simple conditional statements.
